# Professional Self-Assessment

## Introduction
This professional self-assessment reflects on how my capstone project showcases both my strengths and weaknesses. It also highlights my journey into the world of technologyâ€”from what first inspired me to pursue this path to where I am today.

## Career Journey
My interest in technology began at a young age when I received my first computer. As an Asian American child, I often found myself troubleshooting and fixing computer issues for my family. This early exposure to problem-solving sparked a passion that grew over time.  

From building computers to developing programs and applications, I became deeply invested in learning how things work and how I could improve them. This love for discovery and continuous learning has guided my path toward a career in software engineering and IT.

## Professional Goals
My primary professional goal is to learn and grow within a community that values collaboration and knowledge-sharing. I am open to starting from the ground up because I believe that no matter how skilled someone is, there is always more to learn.  

I plan to work in an environment that encourages growth, where I can acquire new skills daily. My dedication to lifelong learning is one of my greatest strengths, as I never want to become complacent. I aim to prove that consistent effort and curiosity can pave the way to success.

## Strengths and Skills
I consider myself a strong team player. I practice teamwork and collaboration dailyâ€”even in unconventional settings such as online games like *League of Legends*, where success depends on coordination and communication. Although gaming may seem unrelated to professional work, it has taught me valuable skills like leadership, adaptability, and working under pressure.  

I am also confident in my ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders. I can present ideas, gather feedback, and incorporate improvements into projects. My strengths lie in hands-on learning, innovation, and creative problem-solving.

## First Enhancement: Mobile Gym Diary App
My first enhancement involved modifying a previous projectâ€”an event-tracking mobile appâ€”into a daily gym diary. As someone who visits the gym regularly, I wanted to create a practical app to log workouts and track progress.  

This project showcased my **software design and engineering** skills. I redesigned the app to include new features like diary entries and integrated an **encrypted database** to secure usersâ€™ personal information. This enhancement demonstrated my ability to adapt existing systems for new use cases while ensuring data protection and user privacy.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Software Design and Engineering  
- Database Security and Encryption  
- UI/UX Innovation  

## Second Enhancement: Custom Discount Code Extension
The second enhancement built upon an existing project I developed for a client. The goal was to create a browser extension similar to Honey, but tailored for wholesale businesses. The extension allowed users to import or paste custom discount codes and automatically check their validity.

The initial version worked but did not meet my expectations due to time constraints. After the project deadline, I revisited and improved itâ€”adding missing features, refining performance, and ensuring full functionality.  

This experience strengthened my **problem-solving**, **client communication**, and **software maintenance** skills. It also demonstrated my commitment to delivering high-quality results, even beyond the initial requirements.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Full-Stack Extension Development  
- Client-Based Feature Enhancements  
- Problem Solving and Continuous Improvement  

## Conclusion
Through these projects, Iâ€™ve demonstrated technical growth, adaptability, and dedication to learning. My capstone showcases how far Iâ€™ve comeâ€”from curious child tinkering with computers to a motivated professional eager to contribute to the tech industry.  

I am confident that with continued effort and mentorship, I can evolve into a skilled software engineer who not only builds solutions but also inspires others to learn and grow.
